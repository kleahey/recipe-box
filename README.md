# RecipeBox

**RecipeBox** is a personal project that I started from scratch to help me solidify my knowledge of Ruby on Rails.

The Wiki is available as a guide for the entire build of the project.

Some current features of **RecipeBox**:

* Bootstrap 4 Integration

* SimpleForm gem utilized for forms

* PaperClip gem utilized for attaching images of Recipes

Future features I plan to incorporate:

* WYSYWIG text entry for a Recipe's Ingredients and Directions

* Amazon S3 file storage for storing

* ...and more to come!
