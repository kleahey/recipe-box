# RecipeBox

**RecipeBox** is a personal project that I started from scratch to help me solidify my knowledge of Ruby on Rails.

The Wiki is available as a guide for the entire build of the project.

Features in the current version of **RecipeBox**:

* User accounts keep your recipes private

* Bootstrap 4 Integration

* Simple Form gem utilized for forms

* Paperclip gem utilized for attaching images of Recipes

* WYSYWIG text entry with "Bootsy" for a Recipe's Ingredients and Directions

* Amazon S3 file storage for storing photos of recipes

Future features I plan to incorporate:

* User profiles

* Add the ability to see your friends' recipes

* Recipe tags and categories

* Recipe ratings

* Serving sizes, prep times, nutritional information, etc.

* ...and more to come!
